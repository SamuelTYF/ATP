# Horn Clause

## Alfred Horn (1918 – 2001)

an American mathematician notable for his work in lattice theory and universal algebra.

## Horn Clause[^1]

Determining sentences which are true of a direct union provided they are true of some factor algebra.

$$
\vee \alpha_i\to \wedge\beta_j
$$

If the conclusion has no more than one element, it calls **horn clause**

If the conclusion is empty, it calls **headless horn clause**

if the conclusion has one element, it calls **headed horn clause**

$\alpha\to$ indicates $\alpha$ is true

$\to\beta$ indicates $\beta$ is false

$\{\lnot P_1,...,\lnot P_2\}$ is called a **negative clause** or **goal clause**
